## Introduction

GitHub Gists Manager is a Vue.js application developed to simplify the management of GitHub Gists. It allows users to authenticate using OAuth flow, access and edit their Gists, view gist contents, and more.

## Setup

To set up the project locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository: `git clone <repository-url>`
2. Navigate to the project directory: `cd github-gists-manager`
3. Install dependencies: `npm install`
4. Run the development server: `npm run serve`
5. Access the application at `http://localhost:8080` in your web browser.

## Features

- **OAuth Authentication:** Users can authenticate using the OAuth flow to access their GitHub Gists.
- **List Gists:** View a list of all Gists associated with the authenticated user.
- **View Gist Content:** Clicking on a Gist from the list allows users to view its content.
- **Edit Gist:** Users can edit the content of their Gists.
- **Remove Gist:** Delete unwanted Gists.

## Optional Features

Although not implemented, the following optional features can be added to enhance the application further:

- **Gist Filtering:** Allow users to filter Gists based on criteria such as user's Gists, other people's Gists, starred/unstarred Gists, etc.
- **Stats Display:** Show statistics such as "showing 5 of 10 total Gists."
- **Create Gist:** Enable users to create new Gists.
- **Star/Unstar Gist:** Allow users to star or unstar Gists.
- **Accessibility:** Ensure the application follows web accessibility standards.
- **GitHub Workflow:** Configure a GitHub workflow to run unit tests as a PR check.

## Deployment

The frontend application is deployed to GitHub Pages. You can access it [here](<https://aluisalinhares.github.io/gists-manager/>).

## Testing

Unit tests have been implemented for at least IconButton component. To run tests, use the command: `npm test`.


## Additional Notes

The project handles proxying to overcome CORS in development mode, ensuring smooth interaction with GitHub's REST API. In addition to this, a Netlify Express server has been implemented to handle certain requests, such as accessing the token for authorization. This server acts as a proxy to bypass CORS restrictions and facilitates seamless communication between the frontend application and GitHub's API.

Happy Gisting! ðŸš€
